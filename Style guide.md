# General component rules
* All parts should have the correct reference designator set. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_designator#Designators).
* All parts should have the comment set as the part number.
* All parts should have a datalink parameter set.
* All parts should have pricing information attached.

# Naming rules

* Passives should have a SI prefix appended to them with correct capitalization. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix#List_of_SI_prefixes).
* Passives should not have a SI prefix appended to them if there isn't one (i.e. a resistor with 100 ohms of resistance would be labeled '100')
* Passives should not have a unit appended to them (i.e. a 100 nano Farad capacitor should be marked as 100n, not 100nF or 100nf).
* SI prefixes appended to components should not have a space between the value and the unit (i.e. 100m not 100 m).
* The SI prefix for micro should be replaced with 'u' (i.e. 100u not 100Î¼)
